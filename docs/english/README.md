## What is Knife
`Knife` is a concise and efficient object-oriented programming language.
<br>
The original intention of the design is to design a computer language that is more suitable for writing web crawler programs.
## Is it compiled or interpreted
At present, the technology is not mature, so `Knife` belongs to compiled language in the early stage. After writing the program, the generated code will be linked to the system executable file through the linker for easy operation.At present, the technology is not mature, so Knife' belongs to compiled language in the early stage.
